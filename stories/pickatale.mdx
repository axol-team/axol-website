## The Challenge: From Nordic B2C Success to Global School Solution

Pickatale, an innovative EdTech company, had already captured the hearts of families in Norway with their engaging mobile reading app for children aged 0-8. Their vision was ambitious: to expand this love for reading into schools worldwide. However, transitioning from a direct-to-consumer model to a robust, scalable solution for educational institutions presented significant hurdles. They had struggled to deliver a product that met the specific needs of teachers and school administrators on a global scale. This was a critical time for the business, requiring a strategic shift and expert development to unlock the vast potential of the international schools market.

## Our Solution: Expertise-Driven Development for Educational Impact

Joining Pickatale at this pivotal moment, we leveraged our experience in EdTech and complex platform development to address their challenges head-on. Our approach focused on:

- **Insightful Teacher Dashboards:** We designed and built comprehensive dashboards providing educators with valuable insights into student reading progress, engagement levels, and areas needing support. This empowered teachers to tailor their approach and effectively manage their classrooms' literacy development.
- **Enhanced Reader Experience with EPUB:** Moving away from a homebrew format, we implemented a reader experience built around the EPUB standard. This not only improved accessibility and compatibility but also streamlined content management and allowed for a richer, more interactive reading experience for pupils.
- **Streamlined School Onboarding Portal:** To facilitate global adoption, we developed a sophisticated onboarding portal. This system enabled educational bodies to easily manage their structures, allowing for the clear organisation of students into distinct Organisations, Schools, and Classes, simplifying administration and user management.

Within a demanding timeframe, we delivered a transformed platform ready for the global education market.
