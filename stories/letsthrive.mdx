When TV Personality and Educator Baasit Siddique walked into our Leeds office in early 2024, we could feel his enthusiasm radiating through the room. His vision was clear and compelling: to revolutionise how we nurture character development in young people across the UK. This wasn't just another education platform – this was about transforming lives.

## A Vision Born from Experience

Having spent years delivering powerful motivational workshops in schools, Baasit had witnessed firsthand how the right guidance and support could ignite a spark in young minds. His program, built around "The 7 C's to Thrive," wasn't just a theoretical framework – it was a proven pathway to success that had already touched thousands of lives:

- **Curiosity** - The spark that ignites learning
- **Creativity** - The power to imagine and innovate
- **Communication** - The bridge between ideas and impact
- **Collaboration** - The strength found in unity
- **Compromise** - The wisdom to find common ground
- **Courage** - The heart to face challenges
- **Community** - The foundation that supports growth

## Bringing the Vision to Life

Together with Baasit, we embarked on an exciting journey to transform this impactful in-person program into a digital experience that could reach every corner of the UK. The program unfolds across three carefully crafted tiers:

### Tier 1: Motivate and Celebrate

Picture a school assembly where young champions rise to receive recognition for embodying the 7 C's. These aren't just ceremonies – they're moments that validate effort, celebrate growth, and inspire peers. Every medal and certificate tells a story of personal development and achievement.

### Tier 2: Passport to Thrive

This is where the magic of self-discovery happens. Students embark on a personal journey, documenting their growth through the lens of the 7 C's. It's not just about checking boxes – it's about understanding oneself, reflecting on progress, and building confidence through achievement.

### Tier 3: Projects to Thrive

Here, theory transforms into action. Students dive into real-world projects that challenge them to apply the 7 C's in meaningful ways. From digital literacy ventures to public speaking challenges, each project is a stepping stone toward future success.

## The Digital Evolution

Our challenge was clear: how do we capture the energy and impact of Baasit's in-person sessions in a digital format? Through intensive workshops and close collaboration, we crafted a platform that doesn't just teach – it inspires, guides, and celebrates.

The result? A dynamic digital ecosystem that brings together:

- Interactive journeys through each of the 7 C's
- Intuitive tools for tracking and celebrating progress
- Rich resources that empower educators
- Digital portfolios that showcase student growth
- Seamless school integration features

> The wealth of knowledge they (AXOL) have. They have talked me through what makes a good EdTech Product. I've got so much more confidence in what the Let's Thrive platform's going to look like and, most importantly, how it's going to support schools.
> Let's Thrive is all about helping young people recognise, develop and celebrate character traits that will help them succeed in education and beyond. I was touched by the support, well wishes and agreed plans for how Let's Thrive can be used as a way to 'add teeth' to the already impactful work happening across education.

## The Journey Continues

This is just the beginning. As Let's Thrive grows, we're excited to:

- Expand our library of transformative projects
- Refine features based on real-world impact
- Reach more schools across the UK
- Measure and celebrate student successes
- Build partnerships that amplify our impact
