When TV Personality and Educator Baasit Siddiqui walked into our Leeds office in early 2024, we could feel his enthusiasm radiating through the room. His vision was clear and compelling: to revolutionise how we nurture character development in young people across the UK. This wasn't just another education platform – this was about transforming lives.

## A Vision Born from Experience

Having spent years delivering powerful motivational workshops in schools, Baasit had witnessed firsthand how the right guidance and support could ignite a spark in young minds. His program, built around "The 7 C's to Thrive," wasn't just a theoretical framework – it was a proven pathway to success that had already touched thousands of lives:

- **Curiosity** - Encouraging students to always ask 'why' in this digital age and keep believing in the power of 'what if'. Help them cautiously embrace the future in a critical and optimistic way.
- **Creativity** - Celebrating those lightbulb moments. Whether it's a piece of art work, an idea for an imaginative story or an exciting marketing campaign, your students creativity deserves a spotlight.
- **Communication** - Even the best ideas are lost if they are not communicated effectively. Whether it's in writing or speech, to one or many, in person or recorded give students a voice.
- **Collaboration** - Amplifying progress through working together. Highlight the importance of building, leading and listening to a team. Learning to work in partnership will always lead to success.
- **Compromise** - Respecting other students ideas and have theirs respected in return is a vital skill. Celebrating the art of disagreeing agreeably takes time and patience, but will always lead to constructive progress.
- **Courage** - Courage isn't about never being afraid. It's about feeling scared and still trying. Celebrate students for embracing risk, failure, and fear, knowing that these are the steps to their progress.
- **Community** - Community comes in all shapes and sizes. Help your students find their tribe and see the impact serving their community can have on their well being, progress and solution focussed mindset.

## Bringing the Vision to Life

Together with Baasit, we embarked on an exciting journey to transform this impactful in-person program into a digital experience that could reach every corner of the UK. The program unfolds across three carefully crafted tiers:

### Tier 1: Motivate and Celebrate

Picture a school assembly where young champions rise to receive recognition for embodying the 7 C's. These aren't just ceremonies – they're moments that validate effort, celebrate growth, and inspire peers. Every medal and certificate tells a story of personal development and achievement.

### Tier 2: Passport to Thrive

This is where the magic of self-discovery happens. Students embark on a personal journey, documenting their growth through the lens of the 7 C's. It's not just about checking boxes – it's about understanding oneself, reflecting on progress, and building confidence through achievement.

### Tier 3: Projects to Thrive

Here, theory transforms into action. Students dive into real-world projects that challenge them to apply the 7 C's in meaningful ways. From digital literacy ventures to public speaking challenges, each project is a stepping stone toward future success.

## The Digital Evolution

Our challenge was clear: how do we capture the energy and impact of Baasit's in-person sessions in a digital format? Through intensive workshops and close collaboration, we crafted a platform that doesn't just teach – it inspires, guides, and celebrates.

The result? A dynamic digital ecosystem that brings together:

- Interactive journeys through each of the 7 C's
- Intuitive tools for tracking and celebrating progress
- Rich resources that empower educators
- Digital portfolios that showcase student growth
- Seamless school integration features

> The wealth of knowledge they (AXOL) have. They have talked me through what makes a good EdTech Product. I've got so much more confidence in what the Let's Thrive platform's going to look like and, most importantly, how it's going to support schools.
> Let's Thrive is all about helping young people recognise, develop and celebrate character traits that will help them succeed in education and beyond. I was touched by the support, well wishes and agreed plans for how Let's Thrive can be used as a way to 'add teeth' to the already impactful work happening across education.

## The Journey Continues

This is just the beginning. As Let's Thrive grows, we're excited to:

- Expand our library of transformative projects
- Refine features based on real-world impact
- Reach more schools across the UK
- Measure and celebrate student successes
- Build partnerships that amplify our impact
