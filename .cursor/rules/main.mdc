When writing any front-end code, always use the existing Tailwind variables for colours: [tailwind.config.ts](mdc:tailwind.config.ts)

Always write copy in British English

Always refer to [axol.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/axol.mdc) to understand what our business does.

Always try to use server components before using Client components.

Page.tsx files should always be server components.

Always break pages into components and store the components in the /components folder.

Components should be stored in folders relating to their purpose, eg: Components related to Pricing, should belong in the following folder: /components/pricing

Always check to see if there's a component in /components/* before attempting to create a new component.

The overall UI style should be modern and polished. Any new UI elements should match what we've already created.

When given instructions which contain rules that should be remembered for future work, add them to [appended.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/appended.mdc)
