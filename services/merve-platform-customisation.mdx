## Start with a Proven Foundation

Merve (merve.app) is our ready-to-use digital learning platform that includes all the essential features you'd expect from a modern educational product. Instead of starting from scratch, we take a cut of the current public version and start building from that point. This allows you to save a large amount of the development costs and begin from a strong and proven foundation, focusing on what makes your offering unique.
